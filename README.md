Aura Model
==========

This project has all the Model files for [Aura](http://github.com/aura-explorer)

When combined with an Aura-compatible controller (such as [the reference implementation](http://github.com/aura-explorer/aura-controller)) and an aura compatible view (such as [aura-view-api](http://github.com/aura-explorer/aura-view-api) or [aura-view-explorer](http://github.com/aura-explorer/aura-view-explorer)) aura will work as a fully functional blockchain explorer for altcoins.
